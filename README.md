# SeparatingAxisTheoremImplementation
This is an implementation of 2D and 3D collision detection using the Separating Axis Theorem. The source code was written to be readable and there may be a few places where things can be made more efficient (not in terms of BigO complexity). For example, I segmentize edges to shapes, which does nothing but help readability in the later steps. There is a .jar file in the repository that can be ran to test the demo.  Press '1' for the 2D collision demo and '2' for the 3D collision demo.  To build from source code, import in your preferred IDE as a gradle project. If using eclipse, be sure to set the assets link folder in the desktop project to be a source folder (ie right click the assets-link-folder, under build path 'use as source folder')
